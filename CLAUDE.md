# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for AI Assistants

## What Is This Project?

**LivinWitFire** is a plant data collection and admin tooling project for building a fire-wise, wildlife-friendly, drought-tolerant plant selection tool for the Pacific West (Oregon, California, Washington). It contains 41 plant databases with 866,000+ records harvested from federal agencies, universities, extension services, and conservation organizations — plus a production database (`LivingWithFire-DB`) with 1,361 curated plants powering a public-facing app.

The **admin portal** (in development) uses AI agents to fuse the 41 source databases into the production DB through a Claim/Warrant evidence curation model. See `docs/planning/PRD.md` for the full vision.

### Production Database API
The Living With Fire production app exposes a REST API at `https://lwf-api.vercel.app`. All reference data is cached locally in `LivingWithFire-DB/api-reference/` for offline agent access. Key files:
- **ATTRIBUTE-REGISTRY.md** — the target schema for all data fusion (125 attributes with UUIDs and allowed values)
- **EAV-QUERY-PATTERNS.md** — SQL recipes and key UUID lookup table
- **SOURCE-REGISTRY.md** — existing production sources (check before creating duplicates)

## Key Conventions

### File Formats
- **CSV** is the canonical format — always `plants.csv` as primary output
- **SQLite** databases have indexes for fast querying — tracked in repo
- **JSON** includes metadata (source URLs, rating scale definitions) — skip for datasets >50K records
- **Sources/** folders contain original downloads (PDFs, XLSX, HTML) and are gitignored
- **DATA-DICTIONARY.md** in each folder defines every column, rating scale, and merge key

### Naming
- `plants.csv` — primary plant list
- `plants_full.csv` — all columns when a simplified version also exists
- `plants_oregon.csv` / `plants_california.csv` — state-specific subsets
- `plants_enriched.csv` — merged with detail page data
- `references.csv` — source bibliography
- `variables.csv` — trait/variable definitions

### Source IDs
Every dataset has a unique Source ID (e.g., `FIRE-01`, `DEER-03`, `INVAS-04`) defined in `DATA-PROVENANCE.md`. When merging datasets, always tag records with their source_id to maintain provenance.

### Data Quality
- Match on `scientific_name`, NEVER on common name alone
- Fire/deer/water ratings are NOT standardized across sources — each uses its own scale
- Taxonomy changes over time — use POWO_WCVP, WorldFloraOnline, or USDA_PLANTS to resolve synonyms
- Coverage varies by region — check each dataset's README for geographic scope

## Dataset Categories

| Category | Prefix | Datasets | Key Fields |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Fire Resistance | `FIRE-` | 12 | firewise_rating, flammability, fire_resistance |
| Deer Resistance | `DEER-` | 6 | deer_rating, deer_rating_code, deer_browse |
| Plant Traits | `TRAIT-` | 2 | type, family, zone, height, spread, sun, water, bloom |
| Taxonomy | `TAXON-` | 3 | family, genus, species, lifeform, climate, native_to |
| Water/Drought | `WATER-`/`DROUGHT-` | 3 | water_use, plant_factor, ET0, drought_tolerance |
| Pollinators | `POLL-` | 3 | pollinators, bloom, flower_color, host_plant |
| Birds | `BIRD-` | 1 | lepidoptera_species, bird_value (genus-level) |
| Native Plants | `NATIVE-` | 4 | state, sun, moisture, height |
| Invasiveness | `INVAS-` | 5 | degree_of_establishment, cal_ipc_rating, category |

## The Three Taxonomy Backbones

These are reference databases for resolving plant names across all other datasets:

| Dataset | Scope | Records | Key Use |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| `POWO_WCVP` | Global | 362,739 | Lifeform, climate, native distribution |
| `WorldFloraOnline` | Global | 381,467 | Independent taxonomic cross-validation |
| `USDA_PLANTS` | US | 93,157 | USDA symbols, US common names, OR/CA state lists |

## How to Add a New Dataset

Follow this pattern exactly:

1. Create folder: `database-sources/<category>/NewDatasetName/Sources/` and `database-sources/<category>/NewDatasetName/scripts/`
2. Put original files in `Sources/`
3. Write a parser script in `scripts/` that outputs `plants.csv`, `plants.json`, `plants.db`
4. Write `README.md` with: source, URL, citation, field definitions, data quality notes
5. Write `DATA-DICTIONARY.md` with: column definitions, data types, rating scales, merge keys
6. Assign a Source ID in `data-sources/DATA-PROVENANCE.md` (e.g., `FIRE-13`, `DEER-07`)
7. Update `data-sources/SOURCE-CROSSREF.md` if the source was in the original requirements doc
8. Update `README.md` inventory table

### Script template:
```python
import csv, json, os, sqlite3

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
DATA_DIR = os.path.dirname(SCRIPT_DIR)

# ... parse source data into list of dicts ...

# Write CSV
csv_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "plants.csv")
with open(csv_path, "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fields)
    writer.writeheader()
    for p in plants:
        writer.writerow(p)

# Write JSON (skip if >50K records)
json_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "plants.json")
with open(json_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump({"source": "...", "url": "...", "plants": plants}, f, indent=2)

# Write SQLite
db_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "plants.db")
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("CREATE TABLE plants (...)")
cur.execute("CREATE INDEX idx_sci ON plants(scientific_name)")
# ... insert records ...
conn.commit(); conn.close()
```

## Task Document Process

This project uses **spec-driven development** where design and implementation are separated into distinct sessions, connected by task documents. Full process described in `AI_COLLABORATION_PROCESS.md`.

### Task Doc Lifecycle
```
docs/tasks/todo/          ← Active specs, ready for implementation
docs/tasks/future/        ← Acknowledged but deferred
docs/tasks/completed/     ← Implemented, reviewed, with commit references
docs/legacy/              ← Deprecated approaches (excluded from AI context)
```

### Task Doc Template

Every implementation task gets a structured MD in `docs/tasks/todo/`. The template:

```markdown
# Title — Brief Descriptive Subtitle

> **Status:** TODO | PLANNING | IN PROGRESS
> **Priority:** P0 (critical) | P1 (important) | P2 (normal) | P3 (polish)
> **Depends on:** What must be done first (or "None")
> **Blocks:** What can't start until this is done (or "None")

## Problem
Why this work exists. Specific symptoms — file paths, line numbers, data issues.

## Current Implementation
What exists today, anchored to real code/data. Reference specific files, schemas, record counts.

## Proposed Changes
What to build. Be specific: file names, column mappings, data flows.

### What Does NOT Change
Explicit scope boundary.

## Migration Strategy
Ordered steps from current → proposed. Number them.

## Files Modified
### New Files
- `path/to/new/File` — purpose

### Modified Files
- `path/to/existing/File` — what changes

## Verification
Concrete steps to confirm it works — not "it should work" but "query X, expect Y rows."
```

### Key Rules
- **Planning docs** (`docs/planning/`) inform task specs but are NOT task specs themselves
- **Task specs** are executable — an implementing agent reads one and knows exactly what to build
- **After implementation**, the agent reconciles the spec against what was built, adds commit refs, and moves to `completed/`
- **Legacy docs** are quarantined — agents don't read them by default to prevent context poisoning

## Common Tasks

### "Tell me everything about [plant]"
Search across all 40 databases by scientific name. Check fire, deer, water, pollinator, invasive, and native status. Return results with source IDs.

### "Find plants matching [criteria]"
Cross-reference datasets: e.g., fire-safe (FIRE-01) + deer-resistant (DEER-01) + low water (WATER-01) + native to Oregon (TAXON-03 state list). Always check invasive databases before recommending.

### "Add this new data source"
Follow the "How to Add a New Dataset" pattern above. Parse to standard formats, write README with citation, assign source ID.

### "Merge datasets for [purpose]"
Tag every record with its source_id. Keep multiple ratings from different sources rather than averaging — let the downstream application decide how to weight them.

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install pdfplumber openpyxl requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Deferred Data Sources

These require JavaScript rendering (Selenium/Playwright) or registration and are not yet captured:
- Calscape (CA Native Plant Society) — JS app
- Audubon Native Plants — JS, no API
- NWF Native Plant Finder — SSL cert issues
- TRY Plant Trait Database — Academic registration
- Invasive Plant Atlas — 403 blocked
